# tinyretro

A small sprint retro application I made to learn Rust and svelte

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This app uses Rust on the backend, with a JS frontend with SvelteKit with server-side rendering turned off.

## To debug

```bash
> make server-debug
> make client-debug
```

The server doesn't currently support hot reload
